				<p style="text-align: justify">Hello there! I am a final-year B.Tech (ECE) student, with a strong
					background in robotics,
					computer networking, and image processing. With experience in motion planning, automation, and
					deployment of robotic systems, I am well-equipped to contribute to any project requiring expertise
					in these areas. Additionally, I have a solid foundation in machine learning, programming languages
					such as Python, C/C++, and Java, as well as experience with databases like Postgres and MongoDB.
					Along with my technical skills, I also possess excellent problem-solving abilities, critical
					thinking skills, and a strong attention to detail. <br><br>

					Furthermore, I have been involved in several successful projects, such as Carrom Bot, where I
					developed image processing techniques for coin detection and laser-based linear actuation, and
					Sahayak Bot, where I deployed Gazebo 3D models for environment simulation, implemented color-based
					object detection, and developed a robot navigation map using teleop. In addition to my technical
					skills, I am a continuous learner and always strive to stay up-to-date
					with the latest advancements in my field. I am result-oriented, detail-oriented, and possess
					excellent problem-solving skills, making me a valuable asset to any team or project. <br><br>

					Apart from my technical expertise, I have excelled academically, holding a Bachelor's degree in
					Electronics and Communication Engineering from PES University, Bengaluru, India. I have also been
					awarded the Prof. MRD Merit Scholarship for being in the top 20% of
					performers and the DAC Scholarship for distinction in all semesters. <br><br>

					With my diverse skill set, certifications, and experience in robotics, machine learning, and
					software development, I am confident in my ability to contribute to any team or project. I am eager
					to apply my skills and knowledge in a challenging and dynamic work environment.</p>
				<p>Looking for oppourtunities to learn more about Software Development and Robotics.</p>

				<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="" alt="" /></span> -->
				<p style="text-align: justify;">
					As a skilled professional with a diverse background, I have gained valuable experience in various
					areas, including robotics, machine learning, web development, and SEO. I have successfully built and
					deployed websites, optimizing them for search engines to enhance their online visibility and drive
					traffic. Currently, I am serving as an SD Intern at a SASS-based fintech company, where I am
					actively involved in developing cutting-edge solutions for the financial industry. <br><br>

					One of my notable achievements recently, includes presenting my research paper on "Autonomous
					Vehicle System for Pothole Detection and Avoidance" at the 8th International Conference for
					Convergence in
					Technology. This capstone project reflects my proficiency in developing innovative solutions using
					emerging technologies to address real-world challenges. <br><br>

					My experience includes working as a Project Intern at the Artificial Intelligence and Robotics
					Laboratory at the Aerospace Department, Indian Institute of Science, where I worked on motion
					planning algorithms, automation, and lane detection using ZED camera and Lidar data. I have gained
					hands-on experience in motion planning algorithms, lane
					detection using ZED camera and Lidar data, R-tab slam, and frontier exploration algorithms. I have
					also worked on projects involving image processing, object detection, and navigation using tools
					such as OpenCV, Gazebo, and ROS. My strong foundation in programming languages such as Python,
					C/C++, and Java, along with my expertise in machine learning using Scikit Learn, has allowed me to
					develop robust and efficient solutions for complex problems. <br><br>

					In addition to my technical skills, I hold several certifications from renowned online platforms
					such as Coursera and Udemy, including the Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng, Computer Vision
					and ROS for Beginners: Basics, Motion, and OpenCV from Udemy, and AWS Machine Learning from AWS
					Training and Certification. I have also completed courses in web development, data science, and
					machine learning, showcasing my dedication to continuous learning and professional development.
